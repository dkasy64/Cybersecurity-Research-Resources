CopyOnWrite Explained 

How it works : 

When you read from a data structure, it displays the existing object (no copying). 

When you modify (write), it creates a new copy and applies changes to that copy instead of modifying the original. 

This ensures security since readers will always be able see a consistent, unmodified original version after making changes.

When to use CopyOnWrite 

Best for scenarios with frequent reads and rare edits 

Cybersecurity Applications 

Preventing Unauthorized Modifications (Immutable Data) 

COW ensures that the original data remains unchanged until an intentional modification occurs. 

This protects against unauthorized or accidental modifications, making it useful for secure data storage. 

Secure Snapshotting & Forensics 

COW is widely used to create read-only copies of system states, preventing tampering. 

Malware Resistance & Isolation 

Attackers often try to modify system files to inject malware. 

Using COW-based systems, any modification triggers a new copy, preventing the malware from directly altering critical files. 

 

Ransomware Mitigation 

COW can be used to maintain immutable backups of critical data. 

If ransomware encrypts or modifies files, the original data remains intact, allowing for easy recovery. 

 

 

CopyOnWrite Limitations 

High Memory Usage : Every modification creates a full copy, leading to high memory consumption. 

If an attacker gains root access, they can modify the source data instead of just the copied version. 

Conclusion: CoW is not a standalone protective technique, but it can enhance security by providing isolation, integrity, 
and rollback capabilities. It works best when combined with other security measures like access controls, encryption, 
and intrusion detection.
