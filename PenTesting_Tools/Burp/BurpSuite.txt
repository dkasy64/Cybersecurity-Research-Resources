Burp Suite: Web vulnerability scanner: 

 

Burp Suite is a powerful integrated platform for web application security testing. Itâ€™s widely used by security professionals, ethical hackers, and penetration testers to identify vulnerabilities in web applications. Burp Suite helps find weaknesses like SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), insecure HTTP headers, and many others. 

Key Components of Burp Suite: 

Proxy: 
 The Burp Proxy acts as an intermediary between your web browser and the target web application. It allows you to intercept, inspect, and modify HTTP/S traffic in real-time. 

You can capture requests and responses between your browser and the target web server. 

Modify requests/responses to test for vulnerabilities (e.g., tampering with parameters). 

Scanner (Burp Suite Professional Only): 
 The Burp Scanner automatically scans web applications for common vulnerabilities like: 

SQL Injection 

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 

Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) 

Security misconfigurations 

Intruder: 
 The Burp Intruder tool allows you to automate attacks on web applications. You can use it to perform tasks like: 

Brute-forcing login forms. 

Fuzzing input fields to identify vulnerabilities. 

Performing password cracking or parameter manipulation. 

You can configure payloads (like a list of potential usernames or passwords) to send to the target application and analyze responses.
