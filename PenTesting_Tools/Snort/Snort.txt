Snort 

Snort is an open-source network intrusion detection system (NIDS) and network intrusion prevention system (NIPS). It is designed to detect and prevent a wide range of network-based attacks, including malware, exploits, and other malicious activities. 

 

What Does Snort Do? 

Intrusion Detection: Snort analyzes network traffic in real time to identify suspicious patterns or known attack signatures. If it detects malicious traffic (such as exploits, viruses, or unauthorized access attempts), it can generate an alert for administrators. 

Intrusion Prevention: Snort can also block malicious traffic, acting as a barrier between the internal network and the internet. This is more proactive than just detection. 

Key Features of Snort: 

Packet Sniffer: Snort can capture network traffic, similar to a network packet analyzer (like Wireshark). 

Signature-based Detection: It matches traffic against a set of predefined signatures or rules to identify attacks. 

Real-time Alerting: When an attack is detected, Snort can trigger alerts, logging the event, and notifying the administrator. 

Packet Logging: It logs suspicious packets or events for further analysis. 

 

 

Snort Use Cases: 

Monitoring network traffic: Snort continuously scans network traffic to find signs of malicious activity. 

Blocking attacks: It can block traffic from known malicious IP addresses or suspicious requests based on custom rules. 

Forensics and analysis: Security professionals use Snort to review logs and investigate incidents after an attack. 

How Snort Works: 

Network Traffic Analysis: Snort analyzes packets in real-time and compares them to a set of rules or signatures. 

Alerting and Logging: Once Snort detects a potential threat, it generates an alert and can log the event to a file for further analysis. 

Prevention: Snort can prevent attacks by dropping malicious packets or blocking specific IP addresses, depending on how it is configured. 

 

 

Why Snort? 

Signature-Based Detection: Snort uses signature-based detection, meaning it looks for known patterns of attacks.
